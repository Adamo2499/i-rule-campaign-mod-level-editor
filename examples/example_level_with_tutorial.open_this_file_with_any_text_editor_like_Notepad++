In order to make a level, simply create a .json file in the levels/custom/ folder of the game. Use "example level.json" as reference and use this file to find out what exactly the variables in it do.

To make this file easier to read, take it out of the game folder and turn it into a .json file. Do not try to launch it in-game though, as it will crash due to all these "comments", which are not actually comments because .json files don't allow those.
If you are getting a JSON parsing error while starting your level, check if there are commas at the end of each line that doesn't end with a colon or an open bracket.

All levels can be started with less than 4 babies. Champions will never spawn on their own. Random coin drops are disabled. Poop will never become golden or icy unless specified otherwise.
Flag waves will not display the "huge wave incoming" message on their own, use "displayMessage" and "displayMessage2" variables for that.

No variable/array/table is necessary to start a level, you should be able to play it even if your .json file only has a pair of curly brackets.

{
	"levelName": "Example Level", - name of your level. Will be displayed when hovering over the level name and while playing. "Unnamed Level" by default.
	"levelDescription": "Have fun making your own!", - description of your level. Will only be displayed when hovering over the level file. "" by default.
	"levelNameColor": 16776960, - color of the level name, applies while hovering over the level and while playing it. Does not apply if the level is locked. Accepts both Gamemaker's built-in colors ( https://manual.yoyogames.com/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Drawing/Colour_And_Alpha/make_colour_rgb.html ) and decimal color values, although be warned that Gamemaker seems to swap the Red and Blue values in decimals for some reason. "c_white" by default.
	"levelDescriptionColor": "c_fuchsia", - color of the level description, applies only while hovering over the level if it is not locked. Everything from "levelNameColor" applies to this variable too. "c_gray" by default.
	"levelHeartFallSpeed": 10, - rate at which hearts/cards fall from the sky, in relation to the regular one (2 = drop twice as frequently, 0.5 = drop half as frequently). 1 by default.
	"levelHeartValue": 690, - value of hearts that fall from the sky. Doesn't affect their size. 50 by default.
	"levelHeartSize": 0.75, - size of hearts that fall from the sky, in relation to the regular one. Doesn't affect their value. 1 by default.
	"levelHeartTimer": 300, - starting timer of hearts that fall from the sky. Hearts disappear when it reaches 560. 0 by default.
	"levelStartingHearts": 34, - the amount of hearts you start the level with, before bonuses from <3 and/or Candy Heart are applied. (<3 adds 50 and Candy Heart adds 150.) 50 by default.
	"levelHeartsCap": 999999, - overrides the game's weird 9000 hearts limit. 9999 by default.
	"levelWaveAmount": 54, - total amount of waves in the level. 10 by default.
	"levelBigWaves": [10,20,26,30,45], - waves that count as huge ones, from earliest to latest. Marked with a flag on the wavebar and cause a 'huge wave" message + sound to appear. If big waves are far apart, the wavebar might look weird due to its borders being stretched. [10] by default.
	"levelDrawWaveBorder": 0, - determines if a wavebar border will be drawn. You might want to disable it if you have a long level with few flags. (0 = false, 1 = true.) 1 by default.
	"levelDrawFlags": 0, - determines if flags will be drawn on the wavebar. (0 = false, 1 = true.) 1 by default.
	"levelDrawWaveBar": 1, - determines if the wavebar will be drawn. If this is set to 0, flags and wavebar border will not be drawn either. (0 = false, 1 = true.) 1 by default.
	"levelTimerSpeed": 2, - speed at which the level timer moves forward. When level timer reaches 550, a wave is spawned and the timer is set to a different value (see "levelDefaultTimerAfterWave"). 0.5 by default.
	"levelSpawnDelay": 548,	- initial position of the level timer. Normally set to (-100 - (10 * [level number])). Don't set this higher than 548 if your level has any objects which are supposed to spawn at the start of it. -115 by default.
	"levelTimerSpeedAltCondition": "less", - condition for the level timer's alt speed. If set to "less", the timer will move at alternate speed if the current amount of enemies is less than "levelEnemiesForAltSpeed". If set to "more", vice versa. "less" by default.
	"levelEnemiesForAltSpeed": 1, - if the current amount of enemies is (less/more) than this value, the level timer will move at an alternate speed. Doesn't apply until the first wave spawns. 1 by default.
	"levelTimerSpeedAlt": 1, - alternate speed at which the level timer moves forward. 1 by default.
	"levelDefaultTimerAfterWave": -150, - default value to which the timer will be set after a wave is sent out, unless a different one is specified in the wave itself. In vanilla, this is equal to ((-200 + (15 * [number of the wave that got sent out])) + [random number between 0 and 33]) for waves before wave 20, and simply (100 + [random number between 0 and 33]) for wave 20 and beyond. -115 by default.
	"levelIntensity": 0, - responsible for making the second layer of music play and darkening the borders of the screen. In vanilla, it is set to 0, becomes 1 at the start of every flag wave and then gets set to 0 again after 5 more waves pass. Values above 1 will have the same effect as 1. 0 by default.
	"levelIntensityChangeMultiplier": 0.25, - multiplier affecting how quickly "levelIntensity" changes. 1 by default.
	"levelBackground": "lvl2", - background image of the level. Accepted values are "lvl1", "lvl2", "lvl3", "megaPlum", "ragdoll" and "middleHorn". The last 3 also affect where you can place babies. "lvl1" by default.
	"levelMusic1": "mus_boss3", - main theme of the level. Get quieter as "levelIntensity" gets higher. Names of the music files are the same as ones in the game folder, without extensions. Can be set to "" if you don't want any music to play. "mus_ch1" by default.
	"levelMusic2": "cellar layer.ogg", - intense theme of the level. Get louder as "levelIntensity" gets higher. Names of the music files are the same as ones in the game folder, without extensions. Can be set to "" if you don't want any intense music to play. "mus_ch1_layer" by default.
	"levelDrawTimer": 1, - if set to 1, the level timer and by how much it advanced during the last frame will be displayed above the level name. 0 by default.
	"levelCampaignLocked": -1, - this level is inaccessible until you've finished this amount of campaign levels. -1 by default.
	"levelHiddenUntilUnlocked": 0, - if set to 1, this level won't show up in the menu until you've completed enough campaign levels to play it. 0 by default.
	"levelSpikeBabyDoesntBreakPoop": 1, - not just limited to poop, actually. When a squirt/hardy pushes an object on top of Spike Baby, both the object and Spike Baby get destroyed. If set to 1, the object will survive like it would with other babies. 0 by default.
	"levelDisableCHADScaling": 1, - disables the odd mechanic that makes heart generating babies' cooldowns scale with their amount on the field (+120 frames for each CHAD and +240 frames for each Double Baby, including itself). If you want to use this, you should increase the "productionspeed" value for CHAD and Double Baby via "levelBabyRebalance" because they will be spawning way too many hearts otherwise. 0 by default.
	"levelBobsBrainExtraHealth": -999, - when Bob's Brains grow up, their health will be increased (or decreased) by this value. 0 by default.
	"levelBobsBrainExplodeUponDeath": 1, - if set to 1, full-grown Bob's Brains will explode even if they are killed by something other than self-destruction. 0 by default.
	"levelBobsBrainNoSound": 1, - if set to 1, Bob's Brains will not play their growing up sound. 0 by default.
	"levelFrozenSpriteCap": -1, - if not set to -1, caps the maximum iceberg sprite on non-fully frozen babies to a certain sub-sprite. I added this because babies that have 120+ freeze (which almost never happens in vanilla) look confusingly similar to fully frozen ones. 2 by default.
	"defaultIcePoopDontConvertPoop": 1, - default value of "dontConvertPoop" for ice poop. 0 by default.
	"defaultIcePoopDontFreezeEnemies": 1, - default value of "dontFreezeEnemies" for ice poop. 0 by default.
	"defaultIcePoopFreezePower": 180, - default value of "freezePower" for ice poop. 60 by default.
	"defaultIcePoopEnemyFreezePowerMult": 0.1337, - default value of "enemyFreezePowerMult" for ice poop. 1 by default.
	"levelFlyDontBuzzEarly": 1, - if set to 1, flies will not start buzzing until they are on screen. 0 by default. 
	"levelMaxBabies": 5, - maximum amount of babies you can have in the level. If you have School Bag (check "levelPassivesT2"), this value is increased by 1. 4 by default.
	"levelDisableCoinHUD": 1, - disables the coin HUD. Should be set to 1 if you are using conditions since otherwise the HUD will be obstructing them. 1 by default.
	"levelMulliboomDefaultExplosionBabyDamage": 4321, - default value of "explosionBabyDamage" for mullibooms. 2000 by default.
	"levelMulliboomDefaultExplosionTileDamage": 5312, - default value of "explosionTileDamage" for mullibooms. 2000 by default.
	"levelConditionEndWithHearts": 2000, - if you do not have this amount of hearts (or more) at the end of the level, it will be failed.
	"levelConditionCollectTotalHearts": 6900, - if you have not collected this amount of hearts by the time the level ends, it will be failed. Collected hearts are counted even if they didn't increase your heart amount due to "levelHeartsCap". Starting hearts are counted too.
	"levelConditionMaxTotalHearts": 9999, - maximum amount of hearts the player can get during the level. Picking them up after the limit has been reached will have no effect. Collected hearts are counted even if they didn't increase your heart amount due to "levelHeartsCap". Starting hearts are counted too.
	"levelConditionBabiesKilled": 10, - if this amount of babies have died, the level is failed. Self-destructing, instant-use and shovelled babies count as dead as well. Charmed enemies do not count.
	"levelConditionMaxBabiesOnScreen": 7, - maximum amount of babies that are allowed to be on screen, if the player tries to place more, nothing will happen. Charmed enemies do not count. Keep in mind that this limit can be avoided via the Brown Ritual, Fiend's Imp spawning ability, airdropped babies and shitstorms, so do not forget to ban/not include those things in levels with this condition.
	"customSoundFiles": ["cellar.ogg", "cellar layer.ogg", "Satan find.ogg"], - if you want to use custom music/sounds in your level, put their full filenames + extentions in this array. Files need to be located in levels/extrafiles/ and must be in the .ogg format for this to work. If done correctly, you will be able to use them in "levelMusic" and "playSound" by setting those variables to the full filenames + extentions. Yes, I know that using .ogg for sounds is wrong, but I doubt it will cause any issues with the game.
	^^^Setting these variables used to be mandatory prior to the recent update, but now they will be set to default values if they're not included in your .json file.^^^
	
	"levelWaveChanges": - fill in this table if you want to change *any* of the variables/arrays/tables mentioned in this document when certain waves spawn. You can even try to change things like "levelPassives", "levelWaves" or "levelWaveChanges" itself, but there's no guarantee that it will work properly. If you don't want any of this, you can remove the table.
	{
		"wave3": - when this wave spawns, the variables below will be changed to specified values. In vanilla, it only happens at wave 3 of every level.

For example, Gapers can get 0.2 - 0.425 speedMod when they appear. To check the vanilla boundaries, open I.RULE's data.win via UndertaleModTool, find the monster's game object and open its Create event.

					"timeToTravel": 60, - approximate time it takes for the shitstorm to cover the specified distance, in frames. Tends to be kind of imprecise due to deceleration, so you'll need to play around with numbers a bit. 60 by default.

					"leapRecovery": 160, - how much time it takes for the trite to finish its leap. Usually it jumps when its timer reaches 140 and the countdown gets reset when it reaches 170. The animation will look dumb if you have a low-speed trite, so you can use this variable to change 170 into a different number. However, this can cause the trite to lose its landing sound or mess up its movement, so make sure to test it out first.
					"triteAttackSpeed": 0.1, - overrides the trite's attack speed with this number, even if "speedMod" is different or idleAnimationBasedOnSpeed is set to 1.
					"repeatSpawn": 2,
					"repeatTriteTimerOffset": -90, - similar to "repeatExtraOffset", but for trites. Will affect "leapTimerInitial" instead of "xOffset".

			{
				"text": "Here's some interesting text to read@while babies are shooting at stuff@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@", - text to be shown. Paragraphs are signified with the @ symbol. Normally the text appears at the bottom of the screen, but you can push it up by adding a bunch of @s at the end.
				"delay": 950, - how many frames it will take for the text to start appearing, after the wave spawns.
				"timer": 600, - how many frames it will take for the text to start fading out after it has fully faded in.
				"color": "c_white", - color of the text. Accepts both Gamemaker's built-in colors ( https://manual.yoyogames.com/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Drawing/Colour_And_Alpha/make_colour_rgb.html ) and decimal color values, although be warned that Gamemaker seems to swap the Red and Blue values in decimals for some reason. "c_white" by default.

				{
					"name": "o_squirt", - squirts and dips are technically the same enemy in the game (thanks Hummer), so spawning them is a bit convoluted.
					"lane": [4],
					"xOffset": -90,
					"speedMod": 0.025, - speedMod works as you would expect with squirts and dips, but it does not affect the duration of their dash.
					"fixedDashTimer": 180, - after a squirt/dip finishes dashing, this is what their dash cooldown gets set to. Squirts dash when it reaches 180 and dips dash when it reaches 30. The cooldown is unaffected by "speedMod". Randomized between -25 and 25 by default.
					"fixedDashTimerMini": 30, - when the squirt dies, its babies' "fixedDashTimer" will be set to this value. Don't mistake this for a value that actually affects dips' dash timer. If you are spawning a dip and not a squirt, you need to change "fixedDashTimer". undefined by default.
					"dashTimerInitial": 0, - initial value of a squirt's/dip's dash cooldown. 0 by default.
					"dashTimerInitialMini": -9999, - when the squirt dies, its babies' "dashTimerInitial" will be set to this value. Same rules as with "fixedDashTimerMini". 0 by default.
					"pushForceSelf": 0, - by how much the squirt/dip is going to get pushed back when it hits something. 0.5 by default.
					"pushForceEnemies": 0.1337, - how much knockback the squirt will inflict onto other enemies if one of them is charmed. 0.33 by default.
					"pushForceObjects": 45, - how far the squirt is going to push obstacles it hits, in pixels. Keep the values divisible by 45, as that is the length of one tile. Very buggy when pushing more than 1 object and you probably should not set it to anything other than 45, 0 or -45. 45 by default.
					"dashFalloffMult": 0, - how quickly the squirt/dip will decelerate while dashing. 1 by default.
					"dashDuration": 99999, - duration of the squirt's/dip's dash. 33 by default.
					"dashDurationMini": 22, - when the squirt dies, its babies' "dashDuration" will be set to this value. Same rules as with "fixedDashTimerMini". 11 by default. 
					"sexyDeepVoice": 1, - squirts' screams will be slowed down and will have lower pitch. 0 by default.
					"preggers": 3, - determines how many dips will be spawned after the squirt dies. 0 = no dips, 1 = 1 dip spawned right where the squirt died, 2 = 2 dips as normal, 3 = 2 dips on the same lane. 2 by delault.
					"squirtStage": "squirt", - determines whether you are spawning a squirt or a dip. Unsurprisingly, can be set to "squirt" or "dip". "squirt" by default.
					"squirtType": "gold", - determines the skin and abilities of a squirt/dip. Can be set to "regular", "gold" and "ice". If "squirtStage" is set to "squirt" (or not set at all since that is the default value), setting this to "gold" will double the damage of your enemy, increase its "scale" & "shadowscale" by 0.5 and set its "immunedToGases" to 1. If this is set to "ice", squirts will create an ice explosion upon death and freeze babies that they hit. Dips will only freeze babies and won't explode. "regular" by default.
					"freezePower": 420420420, - when an ice squirt/dip hits an enemy, it inflicts (freezePower/10) freeze on them. When an ice squirt/dip hits a baby, it inflicts its full freezePower on them. When an ice squirt explodes, it inflicts freezePower/2 on babies and, if "dontFreezeEnemies" is not set to 1, freezePower/18 on grounded enemies and freezePower/30 on flying enemies. For enemies, this value is also multiplied by "enemyFreezePowerMult". 180 freeze is needed to freeze a baby. 180 by default.
					"enemyFreezePowerMult": 0, - multiplier which will be applied when freezing enemies via the ice explosion. 0.66 by default.
					"dontConvertPoop": 1, - the ice explosion will not turn regular poop into ice poop. 0 by default.
					"dontFreezeEnemies": 0, - the ice explosion will not affect enemies. 0 by default.
					"dontScreamAfterStarting": 1, - if set to 1, the squirt will only scream when it charges for the first time. 0 by default.
					"canHitSpikeBaby": 1, - not exclusive to squirts/dips. Allows the enemy to attack Spike Babies. Dips do not inherit this. 0 by default.
					"animationSpeedMult": 2, - multiplies the animation speed by this number. 1 by default.
					
					When squirts die and spawn dips, the dips' damage gets set to [squirt's damage]/3, maxhp and hp = [squirt's maxhp / 5.3333], freezePower = [squirt's freezePower / 3]. Most other variables are inherited, unless there is a "-Mini" version of them, in which case the dip's variable will be set to that.

				"checkOccupied": 0, - can be set to 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. If 0, the object will simply spawn at the specified (or unspecified) position even if it is occupied by something else. If 1, it will not spawn if that spot is occupied. If 2, it will deal damage to itself and the object that is currently occupying the spot until one of them dies. If 3, it will randomly shift its x/y position until it finds a free spot and will not appear if it fails to do so. If 4, it is the same as 1, but if the position is occupied by something else, it will wait until the spot clears up and spawn after that. Default is 3.
				"poopType": "ice", - the type of poop which will be spawned. Can be set to "normal", "gold" or "ice". Works only if "name" is set to "o_poop". By default, normal poop has 200 hp & maxhp, gold has 1000 and ice has 800.
				"spawnType": "drop", - how the object will spawn. If set to "poof", the object will also spawn a puff of smoke when it appears. If set to "drop", the object will be dropped from the ceiling. If set to anything else, the object will simply appear without any special effect. Defaults to "poof". Note that only babies, enemies and props will work properly with "drop".
				"health": 69, - sets "hp" and "maxhp" of the spawned object to this value.

				"freezePower": 90, - the power of the ice poop's explosion. 180 is needed to fully freeze a baby. This value is divided by 6 when applying frost to ground-based enemies and by 10 for flying ones. For enemies, this value is also multiplied by "enemyFreezePowerMult". Uses "defaultIcePoopFreezePower" as the default value.
				"enemyFreezePowerMult": 1.5, - multiplier which will be applied when freezing enemies via the ice explosion. Uses "defaultIcePoopEnemyFreezePowerMult" as the default value.

Set to 0.3 by default, which means that an object with 200 health will deal a maximum of 60 damage before getting destroyed (most babies have 80 health).

Usually they are called o_[enemyname]_idle, but some have different names. To uncover them, open I.RULE's data.win via UndertaleModTool, enter the name of a monster into the searchbar and expand the "sprites" list below it. Note that enemy subtypes (like double/quadruple flies and red hardheads) do not have idle sprites, so they will most likely they look like they are walking in place. They do have custom descriptions made by me though. There may also be some custom values not related to sprites, such as "notASprite_littleTrite".
	
	"levelCampaignReward": [-1, -1], - not intended for use in custom levels. Unlocks campaign stuff. First value defines the type of unlock (0 = baby, 1 = active) and the second one is the ID of the unlocked thing. If either of the two values is set to -1 or if the variable is omitted, beating the level will not unlock anything.
	"levelCampaignBeaten": -1, - not intended for use in custom levels. If set to something other than -1, defines which campaign level was beaten.
